# CSharp-Arrays
“This repository explains the concept of Arrays in C# with theory and practical code examples.”

# Introduction
Arrays are one of the most important data structures in C#.  
They are used to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable.  
Instead of creating many separate variables, arrays help us manage data in an organized way.

This project explains the concept of arrays in C# with clear theory and practical examples.

# What is an Array?
An array is a data structure that stores a fixed number of elements of the same data type.  
All elements are stored in continuous memory locations, which allows fast access to data.

Each element in an array is identified by an index number.  
In C#, array indexing always starts from **0**.

Using arrays reduces code repetition and improves program readability.


# Key Characteristics of Arrays
- Arrays store multiple values in a single variable
- All elements must be of the same data type
- Indexing starts from 0
- Array size is fixed after creation
- Arrays provide fast access to stored data


## Why Arrays are Important in C#
Arrays are widely used in real-world applications because they:
- Simplify data management
- Improve program performance
- Reduce memory usage
- Make code more structured and readable

Arrays are commonly used to store:
- Student marks
- Lists of numbers
- Names or records
- Tabular and structured data

# Types of Arrays in C

# Single Dimensional Array
A single dimensional array stores data in a simple linear format.  
It is the most basic and commonly used type of array in C#.

Typical use cases:
- Storing a list of values
- Iterating through data using loops
- Basic data processing

---

# Multi Dimensional Array
A multi dimensional array stores data in the form of rows and columns.  
It is useful when working with matrix-like or tabular data.

Typical use cases:
- Mathematical matrices
- Timetables
- Grid-based data

# Code Examples
This repository includes three practical C# examples to demonstrate the usage of arrays:

- **Example 1:** Single Dimensional Array  
- **Example 2:** Multi Dimensional Array  
- **Example 3:** Array  

Each example is placed in a separate folder with clear and simple code for better understanding.

# Project Structure
The project is organized in a clean and readable structure:

- README.md contains complete theory and documentation
- Each array type has its own folder
- Code files are separated for clarity and maintainability

# Version Control
This project uses GitHub for proper version control.  
Each major update is committed separately to maintain a clear history of changes and improvements.

Version control helps in:
- Tracking changes
- Managing updates
- Maintaining project history

# Conclusion
Arrays are an essential part of C# programming.  
Understanding arrays helps in writing efficient, clean, and professional code.  
This project provides a strong foundation for learning and applying arrays in real applications.
