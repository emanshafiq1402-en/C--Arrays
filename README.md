# C--Arrays
“This repository explains the concept of Arrays in C# with theory and practical code examples.”
** Introduction**
Arrays are one of the most important data structures in C#.  
They are used to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable.  
Instead of creating many separate variables, arrays help us manage data in an organized way.

This project explains the concept of arrays in C# with clear theory and practical examples.
