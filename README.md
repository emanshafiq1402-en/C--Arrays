“This repository explains the concept of Arrays in C# with theory and practical code examples.”

# Introduction
Arrays are one of the most important data structures in C#.  
They are used to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable.  
Instead of creating many separate variables, arrays help us manage data in an organized way.

This project explains the concept of arrays in C# with clear theory and practical examples.

# What is an Array?
An array is a data structure that stores a fixed number of elements of the same data type.  
All elements are stored in continuous memory locations, which allows fast access to data.

Each element in an array is identified by an index number.  
In C#, array indexing always starts from **0**.

Using arrays reduces code repetition and improves program readability.


# Key Characteristics of Arrays
- Arrays store multiple values in a single variable
- All elements must be of the same data type
- Indexing starts from 0
- Array size is fixed after creation
- Arrays provide fast access to stored data


## Why Arrays are Important in C#
Arrays are widely used in real-world applications because they:
- Simplify data management
- Improve program performance
- Reduce memory usage
- Make code more structured and readable

Arrays are commonly used to store:
- Student marks
- Lists of numbers
- Names or records
- Tabular and structured data
